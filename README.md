# CudaText-Haiku
Haiku files for CudaText code/text editor

Files placed here:
- CudaText.iom:       Icon-O-Matic CudaText icon for Haiku
- CudaText.rdef:      RDEF file descriptor for CudaText
- CudaText.rsrc:      RSRC resource file (obtained throug 'rc CudaText.rdef')
- CudaTextIcon.rdef:  Icon only RDEF file

- Folder 'files' holds the needed files to run CudaText on Haiku
- Folder 'hpkg' holds the files needed to create the Haiku package

## File/folder structure
CudaText already sets the 'config' folder in the right place on Haiku, that is, in /boot/home/config/settings/cudatext.

In that location, the following folders should be added:
- data
- lib
- py
- settings
- settings_default

This process is automated by means of the post-install script already included.

This cudatext folder inside settings folder will be removed upon unistallation of CudaText to keep everything clean by means of the pre-uninstall script already included.

Also, the CudaText.rdef file now has some tips on the things I added to the default RDEF file generated by Icon-O-Matic, for future reference to myself and to others.
