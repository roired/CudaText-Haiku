# CudaText-Haiku
Haiku files for CudaText code/text editor



* File/folder structure
CudaText already sets the 'config' folder in the right place on Haiku, that is, in /boot/home/config/settings/cudatext.

In that location, the following folders should be added:
- data
- lib
- py
- settings
- settings_default

NOTE: need to certify this and check which other files/folders should be added there
