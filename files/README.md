# Cudatext files

This is the CudaText executable for Haiku 64bit and the files that need to be added into the /boot/config/settings/cudatext folder when making the package

The file 'default.json' has a new line added in order to include the Python lib in the default CudaText HPKG (lines 1161 and 1162), to default to Python 3.6m.
(Need to think about this?)
